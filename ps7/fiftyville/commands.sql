Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma''s bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.  

id: 163
name: Raymond
As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked them person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.

Hints:
1. Between 10:15 and 10:30, the thief got into a car in the bakery parking lot -- Check number plates of all cars that left during this time
2. Between 10:00 and 10:15, the thief withdrew money on Legett Street. -- Check account number of all withdrawals in this time
3. After 10:15,  the thief called for less than a minute. -- Check who called in this time under 1 minute
4. The thief planned to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville. -- Check earliest flight from here
5. The other person purchased the flight ticket. --?
